‚úÖ Handling Variations in Data Formats and Units
Real-world datasets, especially from different sources like MarketStack and Kaggle, often vary in format, units, and structure. The pipeline you built addresses these issues in multiple steps:

1. Date and Timestamp Normalization
Problem: MarketStack and Kaggle datasets might have timestamps in different formats (datetime, string, with or without timezones).

Solution:

standardize_timestamps() converts date columns to timezone-aware datetime objects using pd.to_datetime(..., utc=True).

Filters data to focus on the relevant year (2025), ensuring consistency and relevance.

2. Column Name Standardization
Problem: Inconsistent column naming due to formatting (spaces, capital letters).

Solution:

normalize_column_names() makes all column names lowercase and replaces spaces with underscores for uniformity.

3. Handling Missing or Corrupted Data
Problem: Missing values can skew analysis or lead to runtime errors.

Solution:

check_for_null_values() identifies null columns in both datasets.

handle_missing_values() fills or derives missing columns like capital_gains as needed.

4. Validating and Cleaning Financial Values
Problem: Negative or invalid values in stock prices, volume, etc.

Solution:

validate_data() removes rows where key numeric fields (open, close, volume, etc.) are negative.

5. Harmonizing Feature Sets
Problem: Some datasets may not contain calculated features like return or volatility.

Solution:

add_features() adds daily_return = (close - open)/open and volatility = high - low for both datasets to ensure consistent analysis.

6. Merging and Deduplication
Problem: Different datasets might overlap in time or ticker coverage.

Solution:

merge_datasets() combines both datasets and removes duplicates based on symbol + date.

üìä Using the Final DataFrame for Deeper Analysis
After transformation, the resulting clean and enriched DataFrame is ideal for trend and pattern analysis in stock market behavior.

Here‚Äôs how:

‚úÖ Time-Series Analysis date_only allows easy grouping and visualization over time.

Analyze how each stock's open, close, or volume changed daily.

‚úÖ Volatility and Risk Insights Use the volatility feature to understand how risky or stable a stock is over time.

Plot volatility spikes to identify key market events.

‚úÖ Returns and Profitability daily_return helps detect high-performing stocks or downtrends.

Combine this with moving averages or cumulative returns to track investment performance.

‚úÖ Volume-Based Insights volume helps detect surges in market interest or trading activity, which often precede price moves.

‚úÖ Comparative Analysis Across Companies With consistent symbol and metrics, you can compare AAPL vs MSFT or other tickers on:

Average daily return

Price movement volatility

Trading volume

‚úÖ Machine Learning & Forecasting Ready The cleaned DataFrame can directly feed into:

Forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet)

Classification (e.g., predicting up/down movement)

Clustering (e.g., grouping similar stock behaviors)

üîÅ Example Use Cases: Investor Insight Dashboard: Daily returns and volume trends.

Risk Assessment Tool: Monitor volatility of holdings.

Backtesting Engine: Simulate trading strategies using historical open, close.
